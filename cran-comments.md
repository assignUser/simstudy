## Resubmission 2020MAR31

This is a resubmission of version 0.1.16

Developed with R Version 3.6.3.

I did not get any notes from win_build and all rhub checks passed, except I received a note from Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 :

* checking for non-standard things in the check directory ... NOTE
Found the following files/directories:
  'examples_i386' 'examples_x64' 'simstudy-Ex_i386.Rout'
  'simstudy-Ex_x64.Rout' 'tests_i386' 'tests_x64'
  
I understand that this is a server-side issue and not a package issue.
